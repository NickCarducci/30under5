      &nbsp;I begin my work on the book I promised I would write. As I usually
      do with large projects, I write as much as I can and reorganize later. My
      investigations vary-from day-to-day, and the problem I am addressing is
      multi-faceted requiring synchronous solutions in govtech, fintech,
      infotech, edtech and of-course legal-action to support a variety of
      Class-action-suits for the consumers and intermediate-good consumers of
      non-financial industries who based on accrual own 1/44 of all the assets
      on earth but make up 2% of the national-payroll; inventors and artists
